IT276-Project
=============

Super rough draft. Pretty much trying to figure things out by removing and adding things in, and LOTS of Stack Overflow.

1 + Left Click = Soda (25)
2 + Left Click = Cereal (25)
3 + Left Click = Candy (15)
4 = Spawn "customer"

Soda -> Can spawn up to 25. Currently finding a way to not have multiple sprites spawn in a single location. Not working properly. 
Cereal -> Can spawn up to 25. Spawns way too fast if left click is held down.
Candy -> Can spawn up to 15. Also spawns way too fast if left click is held down.
"Customer -> Infinite spawn? Holding down 4 will "move" the customer to the right by 1 px. Attempted to have the customer automatically walk across the sidewalk when spawned. Not sure how to "erase" past drawn customers...
